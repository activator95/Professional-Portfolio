                 I'm a software developer who enjoys problem solving. The reason I am jumping into coding is because I want to work in an industry that will never stop letting me grow myself. Currently, I am taking the university of Arizona coding bootcamp to get certified as a full stack developer.

                I am currently a maintenance manager. In 5 years, I went from a tech making $16 an hour to the highest paid maintenance manager in Arizona. I thrive on hard work and growth within myself as a person or a team member.

                <br>
                I'm also a father! I take a lot of pride in being a father! I have 3 kids, 1 girl and 2 boys. I owe them everthing. This is also another reason for my career change. I want to be the best version of myself for them so I can show them working with your body and hands isn't everything.
